<h1 align="center">Dart - Hello Dart</h1>

## What is Dart?

Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

## Key Features:
### 1. Object-Oriented:

Dart is a class-based, object-oriented language. It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to write clean and modular code.

### 2. Strongly Typed:

Dart is a statically typed language, which means variable types are known at compile time. This helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code reliability.


### Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation:

Dart supports both JIT and AOT compilation. During development, Dart's JIT compiler enables fast iteration and hot reload for a smooth development experience. For production deployment, Dart can be compiled ahead of time for optimal performance.

### 4. Asynchronous Programming:

Dart provides built-in support for asynchronous programming using async and await keywords. This makes it easy to write non-blocking code, improving performance in applications that rely on I/O operations.


### Tasks:

### 1. The Quotes

File: 1-quotes.dart
Description: Prints the string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line using the print function.

### 2. Print Number
File: 2-print_number.dart
Description: Prints the integer stored in the variable number followed by "Battery street", and a new line.

### 3. Print Doubles
File: 3-print_double.dart
Description: Prints the double stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits, preceded by "Double:", and followed by a new line.

### 4. Print String
File: 4-print_string.dart
Description: Prints the value of the variable str three times followed by its first 9 characters, each followed by a new line.

### 5. Assertion
File: 5-assertion.dart
Description: Checks if the number provided as an argument is greater than or equal to 80. If it is, prints "You Passed". Otherwise, throws an assertion error.

### 6. Positive or Negative
File: 6-positive_or_negative.dart
Description: Determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero based on the argument provided.
Each program showcases different aspects of Dart programming language and serves as a foundation for understanding more complex concepts.
